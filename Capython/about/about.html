            <h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
            <p>Sisu is more than just a fitness app. It’s a community.<br><br>

            We created Sisu to bring together active people, no matter
            their level or journey. Sisu is a space where you can share 
            your victories, recipes, and moments of motivation. It’s a 
            place where every effort is celebrated, and mutual support is 
            at the heart of everything. Because well-being isn’t built 
            alone it thrives within a caring community that encourages 
            you every step of the way.</p>

        <h3>WHY SISU</h3>
        <p>The word "Sisu" comes from Finnish and represents
            perseverance, resilience, and determination in the 
            face of challenges. This is exactly what we want to 
            convey through our app: a source of motivation and 
            inspiration, where every effort matters and every 
            victory is celebrated.
